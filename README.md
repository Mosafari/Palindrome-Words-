# Palindrome-Words-

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other
 sequence of characters which reads the same backward
 as forward, such as madam or racecar.
 There are also numeric palindromes, including 
date/time stamps using short digits 11/11/11 11:11
 and long digits 02/02/2020. Sentence-length 
palindromes ignore capitalization, punctuation, 
and word boundaries.
